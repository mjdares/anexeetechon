        {
            "question": "How quickly can we see industrial IoT benefits?",
            "answer": "Initial benefits typically appear within 4-8 weeks of deployment. Energy savings and downtime reduction are usually the first measurable improvements. Full ROI realization across all benefit categories typically requires 6-12 months of systematic expansion."
        },
        {
            "question": "What equipment provides the highest IIoT ROI?",
            "answer": "Critical production bottlenecks and high-energy-consumption equipment typically deliver the fastest payback. Equipment with high downtime costs or quality impact should be prioritized over less critical assets."
        },
        {
            "question": "Do we need to replace existing systems to get IIoT benefits?",
            "answer": "No. Modern IIoT platforms integrate with existing SCADA, PLCs, and automation systems through standard protocols. This complementary approach preserves existing investments while adding enterprise-scale analytics and connectivity."
